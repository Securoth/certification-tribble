### Reasons for a Project

A project must have a reason to exist. Reasons can come from internal or external sources, such as:

* Regulation change \(eg, updating your wiring to meet new building codes\)
* Business need \(eg, implementing a new payroll system to reduce costs\)

### Project Results

The completion of a project can result in any of the following unique deliverables:

* New/enhanced Product
* New/enhanced Service
* New Business Asset
