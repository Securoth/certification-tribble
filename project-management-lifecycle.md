# Project Management Lifecycle

## Five Phases

All projects go through five phases during their existence. Progression is not a strictly linear process.

### Initiation

The initiation phase determines if the project should exist by preparing and analyzing a business case. Someone with the authority to sponsor a project will have to approve the business case. 

If the decision is made to move forward, the charter is created and the team is assembled.

### Planning

The planning phase is when all the scheduling and project management documentation is created.

### Executing

This phase is the actual work of creating the project result

### Monitoring and Controlling

This phase occurs concurrently with Executing. Progress is monitored to ensure work stays on track. If changes or issues force revision of the schedule, the planning phase may be revisited.

### Closing
